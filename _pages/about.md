I am a glaciologist at the Program in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences [(AOS)](https://aos.princeton.edu), Princeton University. I am interested in large bodies of ice, such as  ice sheets, ice streams, ice shelves and icebergs, and how they interact with their surroundings -- bedrock,  oceans and atmosphere. Over the years, I have worked on problems ranging from sublglacial lakes and their impact on ice streams and flexure of icebergs to interactions of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets with the ocean and atmosphere. 

In my research I heavily rely on models of all possible kinds - physical, mathematical, analytical, numerical, inverse, ice-flow, global and regional ocean circulation, sea ice and icebergs. I closely collaborate with scientists from the [Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory](https://gfdl.noaa.gov) to develop and apply many of such models, especially the ocean and cryosphere components of climate and Earth system models. 

During my PhD years at the [University of Chicago](https://geosci.uchicago.edu) I did field work in Antarctica digging snow pits and installing Atmospheric Weather Stations and seismometers on the Ross Ice Shelf and large tabular icebergs [B15A and C16](https://visibleearth.nasa.gov/images/69621/b-15a-b-15j-and-c-16-icebergs-in-the-ross-sea-antarctica).
